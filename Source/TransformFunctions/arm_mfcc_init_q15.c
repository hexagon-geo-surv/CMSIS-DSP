  @brief         Generic initialization of the MFCC Q15 instance structure

  @par           Description
                   The matrix of Mel filter coefficients is sparse.
                   Most of the coefficients are zero.
                   To avoid multiplying the spectrogram by those zeros, the
                   filter is applied only to a given position in the spectrogram
                   and on a given number of FFT bins (the filter length).
                   It is the reason for the arrays filterPos and filterLengths.

                   window coefficients can describe (for instance) a Hamming window.
                   The array has the same size as the FFT length.

                   The folder Scripts is containing a Python script which can be used
                   to generate the filter, dct and window arrays.
 
  @par
                This function should be used only if you don't know the FFT sizes that 
                you'll need at build time. The use of this function will prevent the 
                linker from removing the FFT tables that are not needed and the library 
                code size will be bigger than needed.

  @par
                If you use CMSIS-DSP as a static library, and if you know the MFCC sizes 
                that you need at build time, then it is better to use the initialization
                functions defined for each MFCC size.

                   The folder Scripts is containing a Python script which can be used
                   to generate the filter, dct and window arrays.
